A class called Date is created that includes three instance variables—a month (type int), a day (type int) and a year (type int). 

A constructor is provided that initializes the three variables and assumes that the values provided are correct.

A method  displayDate is provided that displays the month, day and year separated by forward slashes ( / ).
